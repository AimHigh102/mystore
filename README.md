**Angular 5/Bootstrap 4: two presentations**

This repo contains the materials of the two presentations: "Angular Applied" and "Angular fo Java Devs". The formaer contains instructions, slides and the 3-hour video of my presentaion of the Devoxx conference where I build a sample app
that uses hard-coded data. In the latter, I build a similar app tat communicates with the Java Spring Boot server.
